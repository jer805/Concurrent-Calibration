# Concurrent calibration using item response theory

This vignette illustrates how two independent health questionnaires can be placed on a common scale using item response theory (latent trait analysis). This process is known as test equating, and in this vignette it is used to predict the scores on one survey from the other. Normally test equating with item response theory involves a transformation equation using linking coefficients, which is similar to using linear regression. However, when two forms are designed to measure a common ability distribution, the IRT parameters from both forms can also be estimated jointly from one dataset. An IRT model for each form individually can then be estimated from those parameters to perform the concurrent calibration method of test equating.
